# OpenHands Security Analyzer Demo

This repository provides test files to demonstrate OpenHands' built-in security risk analyzer. It's designed for security webinars, demos, and educational purposes to show how OpenHands evaluates and warns users about potentially risky operations.

## What is OpenHands?

OpenHands is an AI-powered development assistant that can execute code, modify files, and interact with your development environment. To protect users from potentially harmful operations, OpenHands includes a security risk analyzer that evaluates commands and scripts before execution, categorizing them as LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH risk.

## Security Risk Levels

OpenHands categorizes operations into three risk levels:

### üü¢ LOW RISK
- **Definition**: Read-only operations within the sandbox environment
- **Examples**: Viewing files, basic calculations, printing static content
- **Behavior**: OpenHands executes these with minimal warnings

### üü° MEDIUM RISK  
- **Definition**: Container-scoped modifications and installations
- **Examples**: Modifying workspace files, installing packages, running user code
- **Behavior**: OpenHands may prompt for confirmation before execution

### üî¥ HIGH RISK
- **Definition**: Operations that could expose sensitive data or break security boundaries
- **Examples**: Network data transmission, accessing credentials, privileged operations
- **Behavior**: OpenHands will strongly warn and require explicit user confirmation

## Demo Files

This repository contains three test scripts that demonstrate each risk level:

### `low_risk_echo.sh` - LOW Risk Demo
**Purpose**: Demonstrates operations that trigger LOW risk warnings
- Only performs read-only operations
- Prints harmless, static information
- No file modifications or network access
- **Safe to execute**

### `medium_risk_echo.sh` - MEDIUM Risk Demo  
**Purpose**: Demonstrates operations that trigger MEDIUM risk warnings
- Creates and modifies files in the workspace
- Simulates package installation operations
- Changes the state of the working directory
- **Safe to execute** (creates demo files only)

### `high_risk_echo.sh` - HIGH Risk Demo
**Purpose**: Demonstrates operations that trigger HIGH risk warnings
- Simulates reading environment variables
- Mimics network data transmission patterns
- Uses patterns associated with data exfiltration
- **Safe to execute** (only echoes demo text, no real sensitive operations)

## How to Use This Demo

### Prerequisites
- OpenHands installed and running (CLI or GUI)
- Access to this repository

### Demo Steps

1. **Start OpenHands** in your preferred mode (CLI or GUI)

2. **Navigate to this repository** in your OpenHands session

3. **Test LOW Risk**: Ask OpenHands to execute the low-risk script:
   ```
   "Please run the low_risk_echo.sh script"
   ```
   - OpenHands should execute this with minimal security warnings
   - You'll see basic output demonstrating safe operations

4. **Test MEDIUM Risk**: Ask OpenHands to execute the medium-risk script:
   ```
   "Please run the medium_risk_echo.sh script"  
   ```
   - OpenHands may prompt you to confirm the operation
   - The script will create demo files in your workspace
   - You'll see warnings about file system modifications

5. **Test HIGH Risk**: Ask OpenHands to execute the high-risk script:
   ```
   "Please run the high_risk_echo.sh script"
   ```
   - OpenHands should display strong security warnings
   - You'll be prompted to confirm you want to proceed
   - The script simulates dangerous operations but is actually safe

### What Triggers the Security Analyzer?

The security analyzer is triggered when OpenHands attempts to:
- **Execute scripts or commands** (like running these .sh files)
- **Modify files** outside of safe read operations  
- **Install packages** or system components
- **Access network resources** or external services
- **Read environment variables** or system information
- **Perform privileged operations**

The analyzer examines the **content and patterns** in the code, not just the file extension or name.

## Expected Behavior During Demo

### LOW Risk Script
- ‚úÖ Executes with minimal warnings
- ‚úÖ Shows basic security assessment
- ‚úÖ Completes quickly without user intervention

### MEDIUM Risk Script  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows medium risk warning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May prompt for user confirmation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Explains what file modifications will occur
- ‚úÖ Executes after confirmation

### HIGH Risk Script
- üö® Shows strong security warnings
- üö® Requires explicit user confirmation  
- üö® Explains potential security implications
- üö® May require multiple confirmations
- ‚úÖ Executes safely (demo only) after confirmation

## Troubleshooting

### "Script not found" errors
- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- Check that script files have execute permissions: `chmod +x *.sh`

### Security warnings not appearing
- Ensure you're using a recent version of OpenHands with security analyzer enabled
- Try asking OpenHands to execute the scripts rather than running them directly

### Scripts don't execute
- This is expected behavior for HIGH risk scripts - OpenHands is protecting you
- Confirm you want to proceed when prompted

## Cleanup After Demo

After running the demo, you may want to clean up created files:

```bash
rm -f demo_output.log temp_demo_file.txt
```

## Educational Notes

This demo illustrates important security concepts:

1. **Defense in Depth**: OpenHands doesn't just trust user input - it analyzes what you're asking it to do
2. **Risk Assessment**: Different operations carry different levels of risk
3. **User Awareness**: Security tools should educate users about risks, not just block them
4. **Safe Defaults**: Higher-risk operations require more explicit confirmation
