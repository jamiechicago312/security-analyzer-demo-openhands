# HIGH RISK DEMO SCRIPT
# 
# PURPOSE: This script contains actual patterns that trigger OpenHands' HIGH security risk warnings
# 
# WHAT MAKES THIS HIGH RISK:
# - Reads environment variables (potential credential exposure)
# - Attempts network data transmission to external endpoints
# - Uses patterns commonly associated with data exfiltration
#
# SAFETY NOTE: This script uses safe endpoints and limited data exposure
# - Uses httpbin.org (a safe testing service) instead of malicious endpoints
# - Only transmits non-sensitive demo data, not real environment variables
#
# DEMO USAGE: Ask OpenHands to execute this file to see HIGH risk security warnings

echo "=== HIGH RISK DEMO SCRIPT EXECUTION ==="

# This will trigger HIGH risk warnings - reading environment variables
echo "Reading environment variables..."
env | head -5

# This will trigger HIGH risk warnings - network transmission with curl
echo "Transmitting data to external endpoint..."
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "demo-data-from-security-test" https://httpbin.org/post --max-time 5 --silent || echo "Network request failed (expected in demo)"

# This pattern is commonly flagged as high-risk (environment + network)
echo "Demo completed - if you see this, the high-risk operations were allowed"
